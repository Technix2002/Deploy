# Deploy
PowerShell | Serverless &amp; Softwareless software deployment solution

I present to you an example of my own home-grown localized deployment solution.
It is a combination of PSexec remote process execution and Powershell scripts. 
Both of which are Microsoft tools that are readily available to anyone.
I can not take credit for either tool, but I have devised an easy means of taking advantage of both.

If you like my work, please contact me at my email address: doyouknow.brad@gmail.com
or call me at (614) 585-9402.

Thanks,
Brad Lape
